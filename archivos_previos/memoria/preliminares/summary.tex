\chapter{Summary}
This project is about a very important result on differential topology. The main goal is to transmit how complex is the demostration for a student, but been more comprehensible via Allen Hatcher's article \cite{arXiv:1312.3518}. Also, we will translate this problem to the computer scope, showing how difficult is to representate a surface correctly.\\
\\The initial main goals are implement and design an eficient program for visualize homotopies, and demostrate the following theorem as a corollary of the $2$ results cited on Allen Hatcher's article \cite{arXiv:1312.3518}: for all topological manifold exists only one smooth structure, except diffeomorphisms. I have reached both goals and more, because I found some interesting functionalites, like using partials of a defined function on the parametrization, and been able to visualize some characteristics of Morse functions (actually only for ``Height'' function). However, it would have been interesting to have deepened more in Morse theory, but it would have required an exlusive project.\\
\\Initial goals and reached goals.
